## tibble

### Overview

Overview of tibble package.

### use-case

use instead of `data.frame` since it's more performant and less qwirky

- A `tibble` never changes the input type.
    - No more worry of characters being automatically turned into strings.
- A `tibble` can have columns that are lists.
- A `tibble` can have non-standard variable names.
    - can start with a number or contain spaces.
    - To use this refer to these in a backtick.
- It only recycles vectors of length 1.
- It never creates row names.

```{r "tibble"}
library(tibble)

a <- 1:5
tibble(a, b = a * 2) # similar to data.frame

lst(n = 5, x = runif(n))
```

`tibble` never coerces its inputs

```{r}
str(tibble(letters))
str(tibble(x = list(diag(1), diag(2))))
```

or munges column names

```{r}
tibble(`a + b` = 1:5)
```

With the SE version, you give it a list of formulas/expressions

```{r}
tibble_(list( x = ~1:10
             ,y = quote(x * 2)))
```
